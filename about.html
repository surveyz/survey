			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>Your privacy is important to us. So we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices.</p>
			<h2>Our Policy explains:</h2>
			<p>What information we collect and why we collect it.</p>
    <p>How we use that information.</p>

<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like IP addresses and browsers, then research these key terms first. Your privacy matters, so please do take the time to get to know our practices.</p> 

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>We collect information to provide the most complete results in our survey – from figuring out basic stuff like which browser you use, to details like your processor specifications.</p>

<h2>We collect information in two ways:</h2>

    <p>Information you give us. This primarily includes the answers to the questions in the survey.</p>

    <p>Information collected by the survey. We collect information about the services and system that you use and how you use them. This information includes:</p>

        <h3>Log information</h3>

        <p>When you visit the webpages that host our survey, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. Similar information is also retained by your system when you visit any website and may be collected. This may include:
            <ul>
            <li>Details of how you used the site, such as the pages visited, the date and time of your request and referral URL.</li>
            <li>Internet protocol address.</li>
            <li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language.</li></ul>
            </p>

        <h3>Cookies and anonymous identifiers</h3>

        <p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit the survey sites, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device.

        <h3>Device information</h3>

        <p>We collect information from the device you are using such as your hardware model, operating system version, and copies of files on your system to include documents, email files, any other files, and unique device identifiers. This is to provide a complete data set for the survey results with a high level of detail. </p>

        <h3>Personally identifiable information</h3>

        <p>Any information collected by our survey will not be released if personally identifiable. Personally identifiable information is defined in this agreement as name, email address, Social Security Number (SSN) or IP address.</p>

        <h3>Application information</h3>

        <p>Information about your application installations (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to include the types of programs installed into survey results.</p>

<h2>How we use information we collect</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect from all parts of the survey including your answers to the survey questions to provide a complete picture of computer and internet use.</p>

    <h3>Sharing</h3>

    <p>We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of our research team if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
        <p>meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
        detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
        protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of the surveyors, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>

<p>Results that will be publicly released will include aggregated, non-personally identifiable information. For example, we may share information publicly regarding browser use by age groups.</p>
